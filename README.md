A Simple project for `CSE471` Lab using `PHP` on top of `XAMPP`.

## Group Mates

* **Afsan Haque**
* Azmain Ibn Kausar
* Sohidul Haque sahid

## System Requirements

To test and run the application, or if you want to modify
things according to your needs

you will have to install the following things.

1. xampp

   `XAMPP` version **8** or higher.
   Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
   if you don't have it already.

   After that, create the necessary **DATABASE**, and you're good to go.

2. node

   `node` version 16.15.1 or higher. Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   if you don't have it already.

   To check your version of node, run:

   ```shell
    node --version
   ```
   We need `node` because we need npm as we have plans to add some node modules to
   extend the functionality.
